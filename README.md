## 2. Implementation Steps

### A. Data Collection – Login/Logout Tracking

1. **Enable and Configure Audit Policies:**

    - Ensure that the Windows audit policies are set properly to log successful logins (typically Event ID 4624) and logoffs (typically Event ID 4634).
    - [Learn more from Microsoft’s documentation on audit policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/user-profiles-and-logon/track-users-logon-logoff?utm_source=chatgpt.com) cite

2. **Extracting Windows Event Logs:**

    - **PowerShell Script:** Write a script that queries the Windows Event Log using commands such as `Get-WinEvent` or `wevtutil` for the specific log IDs.
    - **Python Integration:** Consider using the [pywin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32) library or other Windows-specific libraries to access logs directly via Python.
    - Create a scheduled task to run these scripts periodically so that data is collected continuously.

3. **Log Parsing and Storage:**
    - Parse event data to extract relevant attributes (timestamp, user ID, session duration, source computer, etc.).
    - **Database Storage:** Insert the parsed data into a relational database (SQLite for the prototype or PostgreSQL for scaling).
    - Ensure timestamps and user identities are sanitized and formatted for analysis.

### B. AI-Based Anomaly Detection

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

    - Clean and normalize the log data for consistency.
    - Create features like average session duration, login frequency, typical login time ranges per user, etc.

2. **Building the Model:**

    - **Algorithm Selection:** Choose an unsupervised algorithm like Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, or clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) to learn normal behavior.
    - **Training:** Train the model on historical data assumed to be “normal”. The goal is for the model to learn patterns and then flag deviations (e.g., logins at unusual hours or from new locations).
    - **Thresholds:** Define thresholds based on model outputs to decide when an event is flagged as anomalous.

3. **Integration for Real-Time Analysis:**

    - As new logs are ingested, run them through the model in near-real-time to detect anomalies promptly.
    - Store flagged events for review by administrators.

4. **Model Maintenance:**

    - Plan for periodic retraining of the model to adapt to evolving behavioral patterns.
    - Consider a feedback loop where admin decisions help refine the model.

### C. Automated Email Reports

1. **Report Generation:**

    - Develop scripts to summarize the daily/weekly login/out data, highlight anomalies, and compile reports.
    - Use templating engines (e.g., Jinja2 in Python) to craft HTML or plain text reports.

2. **Email Integration:**

    - Utilize Python’s `smtplib` or third-party services (like SendGrid) to automate sending emails.
    - Secure the email account credentials and consider rate-limiting or batching reports if necessary.

3. **Scheduling:**
    - Integrate with a task scheduler (Windows Task Scheduler or a cron job on a server) to trigger report generation and sending at set intervals.

### D. User-Friendly Dashboard

1. **Backend Service for the Dashboard:**

    - Develop a RESTful API (using Flask/Django) that serves data to the dashboard.
    - Endpoints may include endpoints for retrieving logs, anomaly summaries, and historical trends.

2. **Frontend Development:**

    - Build the dashboard using frameworks like React or Angular.
    - Use data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js) for interactive graphs showing session trends, abnormal logins, and security warnings.

3. **Security Measures:**
    - Ensure the dashboard has proper authentication (such as multi-factor authentication) and role-based access control to limit access to sensitive data.
    - Implement SSL/TLS to secure data transmission.

### E. Real-Time Blocking Mechanism

1. **Integration with Windows Security:**

    - Use PowerShell scripts or Windows API calls to enact real-time blocking. For instance, upon flagging an anomaly, the script might disable a user account or modify firewall rules to block access.
    - Make sure changes are logged and reversible.

2. **Alerting and Admin Intervention:**

    - Integrate with the anomaly detection system to trigger an alert immediately if a severe anomaly is detected.
    - Provide a manual override interface on the dashboard for administrators to review and approve automated blocking actions.

3. **Testing and Safeguards:**
    - Implement thorough testing in a staging environment.
    - Use logging and detailed alerts to ensure that any blocking action is both justified and reversible.
    - Consider integrating with Windows Active Directory if available, to manage user policies centrally.

## 3. Development & Testing Workflow

1. **Prototype Stage:**

    - Begin with a proof-of-concept focusing on one layer (e.g., log extraction and database storage).
    - Ensure the data pipeline functions correctly before integrating ML and automated email components.

2. **Model Evaluation:**

    - Validate the AI anomaly detection model with a test dataset before deploying live.
    - Implement unit tests and logging to monitor the anomaly detection’s accuracy.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**

    - Roll out the dashboard and automated report features to a small group of admin users.
    - Gather feedback on usability and refine the interface and report details.

4. **Deployment & Monitoring:**

    - Package the solution as a Windows service or containerize it using Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
    - Monitor system performance, particularly the event log ingestion and anomaly detection latency.

5. **Security Considerations:**
    - Conduct a security audit before full deployment.
    - Apply encryption for stored sensitive data.
    - Regularly update dependencies and maintain proper access controls.
